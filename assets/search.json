To use EPEL as a package source for Ansible.\n    \n      Install the EPEL repository:\n          # yum -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm\n        \n      \n      Disable the EPEL repository globally so that it is not accidentally used during later steps of the installation:\n         # sed -i -e \"s/^enabled=1/enabled=0/\" /etc/yum.repos.d/epel.repo\n        \n      \n      Install the packages for Ansible:\n         # yum -y --enablerepo=epel install ansible pyOpenSSL\n        \n      \n    \n  \n  Clone the openshift/openshift-ansible repository from GitHub, which provides the required playbooks and configuration files:\n    # cd ~\n# git clone https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible\n# cd openshift-ansible\n# git checkout release-3.11\n    \n  \n\n\nInstalling Docker\n\n\n  Install Docker 1.13:\n    # subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-7-server-extras-rpms\n# yum install docker-1.13.1\n# systemctl start docker\n    \n  \n  Verify that version 1.13 was installed:\n    # rpm -V docker-1.13.1\n# docker version\n    \n  \n\n\nInstalling OKD (Running the RPM-based installer)\n\n\n  Change to the playbook directory and run the prerequisites.yml playbook. This playbook installs required software packages, if any, and modifies the container runtimes. Unless you need to configure the container runtimes, run this playbook only once, before you deploy a cluster the first time:\n    # /root/openshift-ansible\n# ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.localhost playbooks/prerequisites.yml\n    \n  \n  Initiate the cluster installation:\n    # ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.localhost playbooks/deploy_cluster.yml\n    \n  \n\n\nVerifying the Installation\n\n\n  Verify that the master is started and nodes are registered and reporting in Ready status. On the master host, run the following command as root:\n    # oc get nodes\nNAME                    STATUS    ROLES                  AGE       VERSION\nlocalhost.localdomain   Ready     compute,infra,master   14m       v1.11.0+d4cacc0\n    \n  \n  To verify that the web console is installed correctly, use the master host name and the web console port number to access the web console with a web browser.\n\n\nFor example, for a master host with a host name of localhost and using the default port of 8443, the web console URL is https://localhost:8443/console.\n\nUninstalling an OKD cluster\n\nTo uninstall OKD across all hosts in your cluster, change to the playbook directory and run the playbook using the inventory file you used most recently:\n# ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.localhost playbooks/adhoc/uninstall.yml\n\n\n"
